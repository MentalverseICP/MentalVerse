## Technical Implementation

### Routing Structure

```typescript
// New Routes Added
<Route path="/onboarding" element={<Onboarding />} />
<Route path="/doctor/home" element={<DoctorHome />} />
<Route path="/doctor/patients" element={<DoctorPatients />} />
<Route path="/doctor/appointments" element={<DoctorAppointments />} />
```

### Authentication Flow

1. User connects wallet on landing page
2. Redirected to `/onboarding` if first time
3. User completes onboarding and selects role
4. Role stored in localStorage
5. Redirected to appropriate dashboard:
   - Patients: `/home`
   - Doctors: `/doctor/home`

### Conditional Sidebar Rendering

```typescript
const userRole = localStorage.getItem("userRole");
const isDoctor = userRole === "doctor";

{
  isDoctor ? (
    <DoctorSidebar className={"z-20 fixed lg:mt-12 lg:mb-20 max-lg:mt-8"} />
  ) : (
    <AppSidebar className={"z-20 fixed lg:mt-12 lg:mb-20 max-lg:mt-8"} />
  );
}
```

### Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "recharts": "^2.8.0",
  "react-simple-maps": "^3.0.0"
}
```
